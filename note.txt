********* Compare int value to double value *************
if you compare an int value to double value, Java casts the int value to the double type

********** Compare two strings ***************
To test two strings for equality, you must call one of the methods of the String object(equals(String), and equalsIgnoreCase(String)). If you use the equlity oparator, you may get unpreductable results

******************** float value, long values **************
To identify float values, you have to type an f or F after the number
To identify long value, you can type an l or L after the number
Example: float interestRate = 8.125F; long numberOfBytes = 200000L;

******************** How the compound assignment operator can cause an explicit cast ********************
int i = 4;
double d = 4.5;
i += d; // i = 8 (4.5 is cast to the int type)

****************** switch statement ************************
Starting with Java 7, the switch statement can also be used with string expression. Then, the switch statement uses the equals() method of the String object to compare the strings. As a result, the strings in switch statements are case-sensitive.
